## **Introduction**  

YOLOv12 (You Only Look Once version 12) is a state-of-the-art object detection model designed for real-time applications. This project applies YOLOv12 to **thermal UAV imagery** for tasks such as **human detection, vehicle tracking, and anomaly detection** in infrared aerial data.

## **Dataset**  

The dataset consists of **thermal images captured by UAVs**, annotated with bounding boxes. It includes:  
- **Infrared (IR) images** captured in various conditions.  
- **Annotations** in COCO format.  
- **Multiple object classes** (e.g., humans, vehicles, animals).  

ðŸ“Œ **Ensure your dataset is structured as follows:**  
```
/dataset  
    â”œâ”€â”€ Train Set/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ annotations/    
    â”œâ”€â”€ Validation Set/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ annotations/  
    â”œâ”€â”€ Test Set/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/  
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ annotations/
```

## **Training**  

Run the training script in the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash
results = model.train(data='path to /data.yaml', epochs=200, imgsz=640, optimizer='AdamW', lr0=0.0001, momentum=0.937)
```

ðŸ“Œ **Key training settings:**  
- **Model:** Pre-trained RT-DETR  
- **Epochs:** 200  
- **Image size:** 640  
- **Optimizer:** AdamW  
- **Learning rate:** 0.0001  

---

## **Evaluation**  

Evaluate the trained model on the validation set:  
```bash
model = YOLO('path to /weights/best.pt')
# Run the evaluation
results = model.val(data="path to /data.yaml")

# Print specific metrics
print("Class indices with average precision:", results.ap_class_index)
print("Average precision for all classes:", results.box.all_ap)
print("Mean average precision at IoU=0.50:", results.box.map50)
print("Mean recall:", results.box.mr)
```

ðŸ“Œ **Metrics reported:**  
- **mAP (Mean Average Precision)**  
- **Precision & Recall**  
- **Inference speed**

## **Results**  

âœ… **Expected outcomes:**  
- Improved detection accuracy in thermal UAV imagery.  
- High-speed inference suitable for real-time applications.  
- Robust performance across different environmental conditions.
